= Stormpath Plugin

== Description

The Stormpath Plugin enables HiveMQ to use the Stormpath authentication framework, for the easy authentication and authorization, of MQTT clients. For this purpose the credentials are set in the Stormpath accounts and there permissions are set as groups.

Stormpath is a user management API for developers, that handles: identity management, user management, and security for applications.


== How to use the plugin with sample configuration

. Copy the jar file to your +<HIVEMQ_HOME>/plugins+ folder
. Set the Stormpath properties in the stormpath.properties file
..  Copy your apiKey.id and your apiKey.secret into the stormpath.properties
..  Set your application name
. Run HiveMQ (Stormpath application and default path are created automatically)
. Setup your Stormpath application
..  Create accounts to set the authentication credentials(Username and Password)
..  Create groups and add your accounts to the these groups
..  The name of each Group is defined as a permitted topic
. Connect with a {hivemq-blog-tools}[MQTT client] of your choice using the username and password set in Stormpath
. Done!
